=== Counts of Distinct sku in skuinfo, skstinfo, trnsact ===

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM skuinfo;
...1564178 ... {also note that there are no duplicate sku in this table becasue
                count(sku) provides the same 1564178}

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM skstinfo;
...760212

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM trnsact;
...714499

=== Counts of Distinct sku in table pairs using inner joins ===
  === skuinfo/skstinfo, skuinfo/trnsact, skstinfo/trnsact ===

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT si.sku)
FROM skuinfo si LEFT JOIN trnsact t
  ON si.sku = t.sku
WHERE t.sku IS NULL;
...849679
# Since 1564178 - 849679 = 714499 this query looks like it is performing as expected.
# Due to many-to relationship between skstinfo and trnsact, we can use the skuinfo
# table to join these two columns by sku since its primary key is sku and all values
# are unique. Yay Dillards!

=== Identify whether store + sku pair is unique in trnsact or skstinfo table ===

SELECT store, sku, COUNT(*) AS Total_Instances
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY store, sku
ORDER BY Total_Instances DESC;
...36099491 rows; Total_Instances >> 1 for many

SELECT store, sku, COUNT(*) AS Total_Instances
FROM skstinfo
GROUP BY store, sku
ORDER BY Total_Instances DESC;
...36099491 rows; Total_Instances = 1 for all
# Find that store, sku combine to form a unique pair in skstinfo table, so can be used
# to join with trnsact table.

=== Count distinct stores from strinfo, store_msa, skstinfo, trnsact tables ===

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM strinfo;
...453

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM store_msa;
...333

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM skstinfo;
...357

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM trnsact;
...332

=== Find common features in table produced when outer joining skstinfo and trnsact ===
             === When an sku is in trnsact but not in skstinfo ===

SELECT *
FROM skstinfo r RIGHT JOIN trnsact t
  ON t.sku = r.sku AND t.store = r.store
WHERE r.sku IS NULL;

# At first glance, and with a few unsuccessful queries into what might be going on with the data,
# I don't notice any common issues. Although many 'interid' entries are 000000000, this is true
# for the entire dataset in general.

SELECT t.sku AS sku_missing_info, COUNT(DISTINCT t.store) AS Num_Stores,
COUNT(DISTINCT t.interid) AS Num_Interids, COUNT(DISTINCT t.mic) AS Num_mics
FROM skstinfo r RIGHT JOIN trnsact t
  ON t.sku = r.sku AND t.store = r.store
WHERE r.sku IS NULL
GROUP BY t.sku
ORDER BY Num_mics DESC;

# Lets me see if there are any obvious patterns in the counts of these variables, but
# so far, no pattern is noted.

=== Calculate average daily profit ===
***Note: although according to practice exercises, this query obtains the correct answer,
   it does not consider the effect of returns on profit***

SELECT register, SUM(t.sprice-s.cost)/COUNT(DISTINCT t.saledate) AS AVG_Purchase_Profit
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
  ON t.sku = s.sku AND t.store = s.store
WHERE s.sku IS NOT NULL AND t.stype='P' AND register=640
GROUP BY register
ORDER BY register DESC;
...10779.20

## Think to find more accurate value we would need to add the result of this query:
(we want to find the total amount that the store paid back to customers who returned products)
SELECT register, SUM(-t.amt)/COUNT(DISTINCT t.saledate) AS AVG_Return_Loss
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
  ON t.sku = s.sku AND t.store = s.store
WHERE s.sku IS NOT NULL AND t.stype='R' AND register=640
GROUP BY register
ORDER BY register DESC;
...-2614.35

Yielding a more accurate average profit of $8164.85... that's what I think anyway.

=== On what day was the total cost of returned items highest? ===
SELECT t.saledate, SUM(-t.amt) AS Total_Return_Loss
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
  ON t.sku = s.sku AND t.store = s.store
WHERE s.sku IS NOT NULL AND t.stype='R'
GROUP BY t.saledate
ORDER BY Total_Return_Loss ASC;
...2004-12-27 had the most return loss, -$1,212,071.96

## This is a big number so to verify that it is within the realm of possibility, I ran
## this query:

SELECT t.saledate, SUM(t.sprice-s.cost) AS Total_Purchase_Profit
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
  ON t.sku = s.sku AND t.store = s.store
WHERE s.sku IS NOT NULL AND t.stype='P'
GROUP BY t.saledate
ORDER BY Total_Purchase_Profit DESC;
...On 2005-03-26 had the max total purchase profit, $5,140,397.75
## In other words, max total return loss represents aobut 24% of max total purchase
## profit... this is in line with returns accounting for about 24% of the total purchase
## profit at register 640. So what's happening on the microscale is, apparently, also
## manifesting in macroscale statistics. Interesting...

## The below query aggrigates sums of returned item quantities by unique sale date.

SELECT t.saledate, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Returned_Items
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
  ON t.sku = s.sku AND t.store = s.store
WHERE s.sku IS NOT NULL AND t.stype='R'
GROUP BY t.saledate
ORDER BY Total_Returned_Items DESC;
...2005-07-30 had the most returned items: 36,984.

=== What are the maximum and minimum sale prices of an item in the database ===

SELECT MAX(sprice), MIN(sprice)
FROM trnsact;
...MAX: $6017.00, MIN: $0.00

## Can also aggrigate on the sku level if desired, e.g.

SELECT MAX(sprice), MIN(sprice), sku, COUNT(*)
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY sku
ORDER BY MIN(sprice) ASC;
...$0 saleprices aren't extremely prolific in the data, but many items do sell way under cost.
## Expensive items tend to sell for one high price.

=== How many departments have more than 100 brands in them, and what are their descriptions? ===
Answer: only three of them...

SELECT d.dept, d.deptdesc, COUNT(DISTINCT s.brand) AS Num_Brands
FROM deptinfo d RIGHT JOIN skuinfo s
  ON d.dept = s.dept
GROUP BY d.dept, d.deptdesc
HAVING Num_Brands > 100
ORDER BY Num_Brands DESC;

Environ, Colehann, and Carters have 389, 118, and 109 brands respectively.

=== Retreive dept descriptions from each of the skus in the skstinfo table. ===

SELECT s.sku, d.deptdesc
FROM (skstinfo s LEFT JOIN skuinfo sr ON s.sku = sr.sku) LEFT JOIN deptinfo d
  ON  sr.dept = d.dept
WHERE sr.sku IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY s.sku, d.deptdesc;
...Confirmed that SKU # 5020024 is 'LESLIE' by adding AND s.sku = 5020024.

## Noted that each of the 760212 skus have a dept description, which is as expected
## There don't appear to be any duplicates. Makes sense because each dept can have
## many SKUs but each SKU can only have one department. Go Dillard's db dev team!
